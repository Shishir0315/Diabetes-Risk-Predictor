# Artifacts and Data (Large Files)

# We keep artifacts folder structure but ignoring large binary files might be smart if they exceed 100MB.
# However, for this project, let's keep model files if they are <100MB.
# If artifacts > 100MB, consider git lfs.
# For now, we will track them unless told otherwise.
